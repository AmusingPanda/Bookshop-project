# Bookshop-project

# Purpose:

This is a simple web application project for IT 231 Web Development 1. This website allows users to view books and add them to a cart. The user can then checkout and the order will be added to the database. They are also have the ability to log in and to search for books. The admin can add, edit and delete books from the database. The admin can also view all orders and mark them as shipped. 

# Database used: 
This project uses mariadb as the database. To connect your mariadb, create a .env file with the following information

DB_HOST=

DB_DATABASE=

DB_USER=

DB_PASSWORD=

I provided my SQL statements that I created in a file named dbExample.sql.
